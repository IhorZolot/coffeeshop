				Americano coffee (Italian: Caff√® Americano) is an espresso diluted with hot water. The presence of foam (cream)
				depends on how coffee and water are mixed. Attention! The concepts of "American" and "American coffee" should
				not be confused. n the second case, this refers not to diluted espresso, but to a drink prepared through a
				filter system.
